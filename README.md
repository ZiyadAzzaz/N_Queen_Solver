# ♟️ N-Queens Solver (BFS & DFS)

A Python-based solver for the classic N-Queens problem — implemented using both **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.  
This project compares the performance of the two algorithms and prints a sample solution on the board.

🎯 Developed as part of an AI fundamentals course by **Ziyad Azzaz**.

## 📋 Overview

The **N-Queens problem** asks:  
> Can you place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other?

This project:
- ✅ Explores both BFS and DFS approaches  
- ✅ Measures time taken by each algorithm  
- ✅ Displays one possible solution on the board  
- ✅ Shows how constraint satisfaction works in AI search

## 🧠 Features

- 🔎 **BFS Search**: Iterative search using queues  
- 🧭 **DFS with Backtracking**: Recursive and memory-efficient  
- ⏱️ **Performance Timer**: Measures execution time of each approach  
- 🎨 **Board Display**: Text-based board output with queen positions  
- 💻 **CLI Interaction**: User inputs `N` directly from terminal
